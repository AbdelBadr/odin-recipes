        <h4>Delicious corn-on-cob does wonder on a sunny summer day.</h4>
        <p>
        Corns are nutritious and can be cooked in various ways. My favourite way of cooking corn is by making those
        delicious corn-on-cob. My children love them, they would pack extras to school to give to their friends.

            Some people may be intimated by the recipe, but if the instructions are followed exactly you will end up with
            the best cooking experience ever.
