        <h4> This is how my recipe turned out</h4>
        <p>
            As a person who comes from a mediteranean descend, I find fish to be a dish that is delicious and nutritious. <br>
            Along with eggs, smoked salmon can add a whole lots of flavours in your mouth. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Some people may be intimated by the recipe, but if the instructions are followed exactly you will end up with
            the best cooking experience ever.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup of butter</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon of dill</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
            <li>Cayenne pepper (to taste)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vinegar</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>English muffins</li>
            <li>Smoked salmon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <li>Stir butter, dill, lemon zest, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper in a bowl 
            until combined. Set aside.</li>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <li>Fill a large saucepan with 2 to 3 inches of water and bring to a boil over high heat. 
                Reduce heat to medium-low, pour in vinegar and a pinch of salt. Crack an egg into a bowl 
                then gently slip the egg into the water. Repeat with remaining eggs. Poach eggs until 
                whites are firm and yolks have thickened but are not hard, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove eggs 
                from water with a slotted spoon, dab on a kitchen towel to remove excess water, then 
                transfer to a warm plate.</li>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <li>Generously spread each English muffin half with dill butter. Top with a layer of smoked salmon, then 1 poached egg. Season with cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper to taste. Garnish with a dill sprig and serve.</li>
        </ol>
